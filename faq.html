<h2>TUMBLETURN FAQ</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px;text-align:justify">
CLUB ID:<br>
Many swim clubs use the Hy-Tek online database (www.sports-tek.com) to record times for their swimmers and submit records to meet organisers. Each registered swimmer will have a unique ID number within that club that can be used to access their times. The tumbleturn app uses this ID number as a reference for searching through the swim times.
<br>
<br>
SEARCH FOR SWIMMERS:<br>
Enter a surname, or part of, and a club name to search within that club for matching swimmers. The search button will take you to the swimmer's Hy-Tek page. Leaving the search field blank returns all the swimmers from that club. Alternatively you can view an alphabetical list (by surname) of all the swimmers for easy access to ID numbers that are used elsewhere in the app. Some swimmers are listed twice as they swim for home clubs and area teams.
<br>
<br>
VIEW TIMES:<br>
Select the swim club and enter swimmer ID number and swim distance in metres. The next field is 'Entries' which is the number of recorded times to list. This is a sorted list with the fastest (PB) first so entering '1' returns the PB and entering '10' returns the top ten times. Then select the pool length and finally the stroke button will take you to the results page. 
<br>
<br>
VIEW TIME GRAPHS BY STROKE:<br>
This graphical output will currently only show on the desktop version of the app. View recorded times by stroke after entering the club and swimmer ID details, the distance, and pool length. The stroke buttons take you to the results page. 
<br>
<br>
GB RANKINGS:<br>
This page is used to view country-wide rankings and recorded times on the swimmingresults.org website, for assessing eligibility for national level meets. Search by family name or go straight to the rankings selection page to select age groups and events.
<br>
<br>
25M TO 50M CONVERSION:<br>
ASA table conversion using the Sportsystems algorithm. Please note that competition entry times may be based on different calculations so check with the meet organiser before submitting times.
<br>
<br>
QT/CT TIMES:<br>
Links are provided to the current list of qualifying and consideration times for major meets.
