<h2>TUMBLETURN FAQ</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px;text-align:justify">
CLUB ID:<br>
Many swim clubs use the Hy-Tek online database (www.sports-tek.com) to record times for their swimmers and submit records to meet organisers. Each registered swimmer will have a unique ID number within that club that can be used to access their times. The tumbleturn app uses this ID number as a reference for searching through the swim times.
<br>
<br>
VIEW TIMES:<br>
Select the swimmer from the list, grouped by club, and the swim distance. The next field is 'Entries' which is the number of recorded times to list. This is a sorted list with the fastest (PB) first so entering '1' returns the PB and entering '10' returns the top ten times. Then select the pool length and finally the stroke button will take you to the results page. Selecting all PBs will list them all for the pool length selected. The Hy-Tek site requires you to accept their cookies so the first time you access the site you will need to select the green coloured 'Accept' button and then resubmit the search from tumbleturn.
<br>
<br>
SEARCH FOR SWIMMERS:<br>
Enter a surname, or part of, and a club name to search within that club for matching swimmers. The search button will take you to the swimmer's Hy-Tek page. Leaving the search field blank returns all the swimmers from that club. Alternatively you can view an alphabetical list (by surname) of all the swimmers for easy access to ID numbers that are used elsewhere in this site. Some swimmers are listed twice as they swim for home clubs and area teams.
