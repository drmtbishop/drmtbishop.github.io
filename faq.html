<h2>TUMBLETURN FAQ</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px;text-align:justify">

VIEW TIMES:<br>
Select the swimmer from the list, grouped by club, and the swim distance. The next field is 'Entries' which is the number of recorded times to list. This is a sorted list with the fastest (PB) first so entering '1' returns the PB and entering '10' returns the top ten times. Then select the pool length and finally the stroke button will take you to the results page. Selecting all PBs will list them all for the pool length selected. The Hy-Tek site requires you to accept their cookies so the first time you access the site you will need to select the green coloured 'Accept' button and then resubmit the search from tumbleturn.
